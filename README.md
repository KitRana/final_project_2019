## The Project
Our goal for this project was to look at various factors of public safety within New York City. We wanted to gather as much data as we could find from publicly available sources including Datasets, API's, and Websites.

With data sources in hand we were able to create and deploy a functioning web application. Below are the tools we used to perform both the server-side and front-end operations.

* Python/Flask: The code to scrape news and social media information from various news outlets was written using Python. We then used Flask deploy the application to the web.
* MongoDB: MongoDB was used as the database to run CRUD operations on the scraped data.
* Leaflet: The Leaflet JavaScript library was used to display our data as overlays on an interactive map provided by Mapbox.
* Plotly: The Plotly library was used to create the interactive graphs used to display EMS Response Times.
